# Machine Learning Files and What do they have

## ML- Regression (Linear)

### DataSet- student-mat.csv

### StudentScore.py

-Basic Linear Model
-Saving the model using pickle
-Getting the predictions

### StudentScorePickleImport.py

-Similar to StudentScore but using the existing pickle created by StudentScore.py and not implementing and runnning the model again.

### StudentScoreBestAccuracy.py

-Looping the model for certain number of times to get the best possible accuracy

### StudentScorePlot.py

-plotting the correlation between the input and predicted values. 2D graph basically using matplotlib

## ML- Classification- KNN

### DataSet- car.data

### CarClassification.py

-Basic KNN Model
-Getting the predictions

### CarClassificationBestAccuracy.py

-Looping the model for certain number of times to get the best possible accuracy
-saving the best accuracy model using pickle

### CarClassificationPickleDump.py

-Similar to CarClassification but using the existing pickle created by CarClassification.py and not implementing and runnning the model again.

## ML- SVM

### Dataset Used- Breast Cancer from sklearn datasets

### SVM_Cancer

-The clustering is done via vanilla svm algorithm
-Accuracy is around 74%

### SVM_Cancer_Optimize

- Clustering is done via adding additional parameters to the SVM, kernel.
- Kernel is basically a process of adding additional dimension
